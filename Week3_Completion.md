## Implementation Details

### 1. Edge Gateway MQTT Client
- Created a robust MQTT client implementation with:
  - TLS support with certificate validation
  - Error handling and reconnection logic
  - Configurable QoS levels
  - Custom message handlers
  - Clean connection management

### 2. Dockerfile Improvements
- Updated to multi-stage build using Debian slim
- Added security best practices:
  - Non-root user execution
  - Minimal dependencies installation
  - Proper file permissions
  - Support for TLS certificates

### 3. Helm Chart for Kubernetes
- Created comprehensive Helm chart with:
  - Deployment configuration
  - Service definitions
  - ConfigMap for configuration
  - Secret management for credentials
  - HPA for auto-scaling
  - Service account creation

### 4. Performance Testing
- Implemented K6 testing script with:
  - Simulated device connections
  - Publish/subscribe metrics
  - Configurable test parameters
  - Performance thresholds

## Next Steps (Week 4)
Based on the roadmap, Week 4 will focus on API implementation:
- Create OpenAPI specification
- Generate API routes from specification
- Set up documentation site
- Deploy documentation with GitHub Actions
- Create integration documentation
- Verify documentation rendering with Mermaid diagrams
