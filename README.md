# D-Central Mesh

D-Central Mesh is a modular, service-oriented platform that provides a comprehensive infrastructure for decentralized governance and collaboration. It combines blockchain-based DAO mechanisms, decentralized storage, AI-powered decision making, and advanced web technologies.

## Overview

D-Central Mesh serves as the unifying layer for the D-Central ecosystem, connecting various components including:

- Decentralized AI Governance Platform (DAGP)
- Portfolio and profile management
- Blockchain integration services
- Cross-chain federation capabilities

## Features

- **Governance Infrastructure**: DAO tooling, proposal management, and voting mechanisms
- **AI Integration**: Intelligent analysis, risk assessment, and decision support
- **Cross-Chain Support**: Multi-chain operations and asset management
- **Service Registry**: Plug-and-play integration of platform components

## Architecture

The platform follows a modular, service-oriented architecture with multiple interconnected layers:

- **Blockchain Layer**: Smart contract execution (Ethereum, Polygon, others)
- **Storage Layer**: Decentralized content management (IPFS)
- **Governance Layer**: DAO frameworks and voting mechanisms
- **AI Layer**: Machine learning models with blockchain oracles
- **Frontend Layer**: React-based UI components
- **Service Interface Layer**: REST APIs and service manifests

## Getting Started

This repository is currently in early development. More detailed setup instructions will be provided as the project progresses.
