## Recommended Project Board Setup

To organize your project board optimally for the 90-day roadmap, follow these steps:

1. **Open your project board** in a web browser using the URL above

2. **Create Views for different perspectives**:
   - Click "+ New View" in the top left
   - Create the following views:
     - **Roadmap by Week** (group by Milestone)
     - **By Type** (group by Labels)
     - **Current Sprint** (filtered to current week)
     - **By Status** (default kanban view)

3. **Configure the "Roadmap by Week" view**:
   - Click the "..." menu → "Configure view"
   - Under "Group by", select "Milestone"
   - Sort by "Title" 
   - This gives you a perfect 12-week roadmap visualization

4. **Configure the "By Type" view**:
   - Click the "..." menu → "Configure view"
   - Under "Group by", select "Labels"
   - This gives you tasks organized by category (legal, design, etc.)

5. **Add a custom Priority field** (optional):
   - Click "+" next to the column headers
   - Select "Custom field" → "Single select"
   - Name it "Priority"
   - Add options: "High", "Medium", "Low" with appropriate colors

6. **Add a custom Progress field** (optional):
   - Add another custom field of type "Number"
   - Name it "Progress (%)"
   - Use it to track percentage completion of tasks

## Using Your Project Board

- **Weekly Planning**: Use the "Roadmap by Week" view to see what's coming up
- **Daily Work**: Use the "By Status" view to track what's in progress
- **Team Coordination**: Assign team members to issues and filter by assignee
- **Progress Reporting**: Use the "Milestone" progress bars to report completion

Your project board is now an interactive, visual representation of your entire 90-day roadmap!
